    "`Shapely` is a planar geometry package) developed by the [Toblerity](http://toblerity.org/) Project. The Toblerity Project is a community of python developers working on open source tools for spatial data manipulation. Right now they focus primarily on spatial data manipulation in python. The project has significant contributions from [Sean Gilles](http://sgillies.net/) and [Mike Toews](https://sites.google.com/site/mwtoews/). I'll show you how to exmaine projects for main contributors now, using [`Pandas`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas).\n",

    "As far as `Shapely` is concerned, \"planar\" means that it can process any kind of spatial information that can be embedded in a plane. For us, this means that shapely processes vector data, and requires that the vector data be on one-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of you, this isn't a problem. But, if you want to do GIS operations on a street network, where overpasses mean that two lines touch without an intersection, this may get problematic. "
